# A Python package for dynamic vehicle routing

`dvrpsim` is a Python package for simulating dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRPs).
This package provides a flexible and modular simulation environment that allows users to model a wide range of dynamic vehicle routing scenarios, with the ability to connect external routing algorithms implemented in any programming language.
